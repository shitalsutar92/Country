Removed file merge conflicts
To resolve a merge conflict caused by competing changes to a file,
 where a person deletes a file in one branch and another person edits the same file,
 you must choose whether to delete or keep the removed file in a new commit.

For example, if you edited a file, such as README.md, and another person removed the same file in another branch
 in the same Git repository, you'll get a merge conflict error when you try to merge these branches. 
You must resolve this merge conflict with a new commit before you can merge these branches.
